### <mark style="color:orange;">**ReDI Values**</mark>

At ReDI, we follow the four values, which give an orientation on our behaviours and actions, both within the community and within ourselves as a team. Here what the ReDI values mean to us:

* <mark style="color:orange;">**Useful:**</mark> We focus on creating real impact, not just good intentions. Being useful means helping others grow in ways that truly change their lives.
* <mark style="color:orange;">**Playful:**</mark> Learning works best when it’s fun. We experiment, try new things, make mistakes together—and build the learning environment we always wished we had.
* <mark style="color:orange;">**Reliable:**</mark> Our learners count on us, and we take that seriously. We deliver high-quality learning experiences they can trust.
* <mark style="color:orange;">**Careful:**</mark> We’re “partners in crime” for our community, helping people go further than they ever imagined. By being flexible and supportive, we grow together—students and teachers alike.
