# About ReDI School

### We are **ReDI**

Founded in 2015, ReDI School of Digital Integration is a non-profit tech school providing migrants and marginalized locals free and equitable access to digital education.&#x20;

We offer our learners high-quality coding and basic computer courses in combination with a unique career and mentorship program, which includes the chance to collaborate with tech companies, startups, and digital industry leaders.&#x20;

We aim to provide our learners with valuable digital skills, a growth mindset, strengthened career skills, and a strong network of tech professionals to help create new opportunities for all.&#x20;

### <mark style="background-color:$danger;">**ReDI Values**</mark>

<mark style="background-color:$danger;">At ReDI, we follow the four values, which give an orientation on our behaviours and actions, both within the community and within ourselves as a team. Here what the ReDI values mean to us:</mark>

* <mark style="color:orange;background-color:$warning;">**Useful:**</mark> We focus on creating real impact, not just good intentions. Being useful means helping others grow in ways that truly change their lives.
* <mark style="color:orange;background-color:$warning;">**Playful:**</mark>  Learning works best when it’s fun. We experiment, try new things, make mistakes together—and build the learning environment we always wished we had.
* <mark style="color:orange;background-color:$warning;">**Reliable:**</mark> Our learners count on us, and we take that seriously. We deliver high-quality learning experiences they can trust.
* <mark style="color:orange;background-color:$warning;">**Careful:**</mark> We’re “partners in crime” for our community, helping people go further than they ever imagined. By being flexible and supportive, we grow together—students and teachers alike.
