# Mid-Semester Students' Feedback Session

**Spring & Fall Semester:** During the semester. Dates will be included on the course sheet.

The ReDI team will meet with the students to collect feedback on the course as well as suggestions from the students. The session is moderate entirely by the ReDI team and results are brought to the teaching team at the teachers' touchpoint.
