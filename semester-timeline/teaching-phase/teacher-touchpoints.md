# Teacher Touchpoints

**Spring & Fall Semester:** During the semester. Dates will be included on the course sheet.

During the session:

**Feedback Session**

1. We’ll review student feedback and reflect on your teaching experience so far.
2. We’ll hold a collaborative retrospective where you can share your thoughts on volunteering — including suggestions to improve content, classroom dynamics, team collaboration, and ways the ReDI Team can better support you this semester and beyond.
3. Finally, we’ll prioritize improvement ideas and explore potential solutions together.

This is also a great opportunity to celebrate successes and exchange ideas to enhance the learning experience for everyone.
