# Interviews / Students Screening

**Spring Semester:** Late February | **Fall Semester:** Late August

**Student Admission Process:**

1. Prework
2. Application
3. Interview
4. Acceptance

As part of your volunteer teacher experience, we invite you to support this process by helping us interview prospective students.

#### **Why do we conduct interviews?**

The goal of the interview is to:

* Get to know the applicants personally
* Ensure they have enough time to commit to the course
* Check their understanding of the course content
* Understand their motivation to join ReDI

#### **Why should you, as a teacher, take part?**

* You help select students who are genuinely motivated and aligned with the course goals
* Your involvement increases the likelihood of having committed and engaged students, which leads to a more dynamic and rewarding class experience
* You gain early insight into your students' backgrounds, goals, and needs
* You support ReDI’s mission to provide equal access to tech education by helping ensure a fair and thoughtful selection process

#### **Our goal**

We aim to ensure the best match between the students’ skills and motivation and the course level.\
Based on your evaluation, we may recommend:

* The course you’re teaching
* A more basic or more advanced course
* A different track if it suits the student better

#### **Tone and values**

These interviews are **not exams** and **not professional job interviews**.\
They are informal conversations designed to get to know the students better.\
We aim for a relaxed and welcoming environment while keeping a professional tone.

The interviews should reflect ReDI’s values of **inclusivity, collaboration, and empowerment**.\
Keep the conversation natural and friendly to help applicants feel comfortable and open to sharing.

Ask about their motivation and previous experience in a way that shows empathy and genuine interest. This first contact sets the tone for their ReDI experience — let’s make it a positive one.

#### **Support from ReDI**

You won’t be doing this alone. ReDI will provide:

* A **guideline** for the interview process
* A **set of questions** you can use as a structure
* Support in case you have doubts or special situations

We want to make the process smooth and meaningful for both you and the students.
