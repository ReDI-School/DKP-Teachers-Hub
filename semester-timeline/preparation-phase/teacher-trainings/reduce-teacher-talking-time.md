# Reduce Teacher Talking Time

This session is designed to help you reduce teacher talk, build student-centered classrooms, and encourage student autonomy. With [**Carla Montrucchio** ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlamontrucchio/overlay/about-this-profile/)'s vast experience in teacher training, online education, and language learning, she will share effective techniques to engage students actively and minimize unnecessary explanations.

Throughout this interactive session, you will discover practical strategies and hands-on activities to develop a classroom focused on student learning. You’ll learn how to design lessons that promote participation and assess comprehension without over-explaining. We will also cover when teacher input is most valuable and how to use intentional silence to give students time to think, process, and respond meaningfully.

Ultimately, the goal is to empower you to create an environment where students become more engaged and independent, resulting in a dynamic and inclusive classroom.
