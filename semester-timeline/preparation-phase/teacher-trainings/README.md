# Teacher Trainings

**Spring Semester:** Early March | **Fall Semester:** Early September

Here you’ll find materials generously shared by our trainers, who have offered their time pro bono to support the ReDI volunteer community. These resources have been thoughtfully designed and adapted to support you in your role as a teacher. We hope you find them helpful. If you're interested in exploring specific topics or would like to connect with a trainer for future semesters, feel free to reach out to us at dcp-volunteering@redi-school.org.
