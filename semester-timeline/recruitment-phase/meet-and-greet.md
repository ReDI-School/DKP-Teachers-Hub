# Meet & Greet

**Spring Semester:** January | **Fall Semester:** July

This friendly one-on-one interview is part of our volunteer admission process. It helps us learn about your experience, motivations, and skills, while giving you a chance to ask questions and share your expectations. We use this conversation to see if your profile, interests, and availability match our courses’ needs for the upcoming semester, ensuring a good fit so you can support students effectively.

**To prepare for the call, we recommend reviewing:**

* The courses in your preferred track
* Class format, schedules and the roles with their responsibilities
* Semester timelines and key dates
* Volunteer expectations and responsibilities
* Your own availability

This will make the conversation smoother and more productive.

Previous teaching experience is a plus, but not required. What matters most is your availability, commitment, responsibility to the teaching team, and motivation to keep learning and share your enthusiasm with students.\
