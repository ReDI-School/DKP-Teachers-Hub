Here's an overview of the key tools we use for teaching and communication. Please set up these tools **now** to ensure effective collaboration with your team and students.

**What is the Volunteer Agreement?**&#x20;

The Volunteer Agreement is a set of mutual understandings between ReDI School and the volunteer. We hope that this agreement will allow you to feel comfortable with us. The purpose of this agreement is to create a safe environment in which to perform your role, to ensure respect for your privacy, including keeping your private information confidential and to mutually agree on behaviour that adheres to your rights as a volunteer as well as our students’ rights. Please don’t hesitate to ask questions. Your volunteer coordinator will gladly answer them.
