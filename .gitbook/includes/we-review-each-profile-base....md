title: We review each profile base...
---

We review each profile based on your interests and skills to ensure a good match with the needs of our Teaching Teams. Once your participation is confirmed, you’ll receive an email with your course assignment and be asked to verify your availability promptly. After that, you’ll gain access to our Self-Onboarding process with all the tools and materials you’ll need.\
If no spots are available, we’ll contact you for future volunteer opportunities and add you to our _Waiting List._
