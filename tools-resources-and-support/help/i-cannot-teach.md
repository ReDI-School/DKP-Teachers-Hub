# I cannot teach

As part of team planning and management, we kindly ask all teachers to share their availability in advance, both during the[ Planning Session](../../welcome/semester-timeline/preparation-phase/planning-session.md) (before the semester begins) and the [Teacher Touchpoint ](../../welcome/semester-timeline/teaching-phase/teacher-touchpoints.md)(mid-semester check-in).\
This includes signing up for specific teaching sessions and also volunteering as a backup in case of any unexpected changes.

As a member of the teaching team—not just a solo teacher—your communication, commitment, and clarity around availability are incredibly valuable. This helps ensure a smooth and supportive experience for everyone involved: your students, your fellow teachers, and the [ReDI Support Team](/broken/pages/q9wYFqzPpCTBsZPmuH2g)\
When someone commits to teaching, the entire team counts on their active participation to deliver a consistent and high-quality learning experience.

**What to do if you cannot teach a session**

No worries—things happen! Let’s work together to find a substitute:

* **If it's up to one week before** **your session:** Inform your team and request a substitute. Mention @channel in your teaching team Slack channel to make sure the message is seen.
* **If it’s two days before or less**: Post in your team channel **as soon as possible** to ensure visibility, and also contact the [ReDI Support Team](/broken/pages/q9wYFqzPpCTBsZPmuH2g) directly for assistance.
