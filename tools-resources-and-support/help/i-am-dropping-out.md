# I am dropping out

### Drop Out

We understand that sometimes, due to personal or professional circumstances, a teacher may make the decision to leave the class. We want to express our respect for their choice and appreciate the time and effort they have dedicated so far. We are here to support in the transition and ensure that the process is as smooth as possible for everyone involved.

* Please notify someone from the [ReDI Team](/broken/pages/q9wYFqzPpCTBsZPmuH2g) about your decision
* After that, notify your team; you can mention your reasons if you feel comfortable
* You will be removed from the Course Slack Channel and Google Calendar
* Let us know if you need any proof of volunteering
* Finally, fill out[ this questionnaire](https://redischool.typeform.com/to/tv7sFDLX?typeform-source=www.google.com)
