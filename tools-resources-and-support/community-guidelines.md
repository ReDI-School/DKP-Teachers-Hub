### Our Code of Conduct <a href="#h.b83t01mar2r5_l" id="h.b83t01mar2r5_l"></a>

ReDI School aims to be a safe learning environment for all of its community members. The ReDI Code of Conduct sets the standards that allow us to keep our community safe and healthy, both online and offline.  It establishes standards necessary to maintain and protect an environment conducive to learning and in keeping with the objectives of the program.  The code of conduct is important to:

* maintain and protect an environment conducive to learning and in keeping with the objectives of our ReDI School programs
* protect our community and ensure that EVERYONE feels safe and comfortable in the online environment

By signing the Volunteer Agreement at the beginning of their teaching experience, volunteers agree to respect the ReDI Code of Conduct during their volunteer experience and interactions with students, other volunteers, as well as with the ReDI team and community.

<details>

<summary>Code Outline</summary>

* The ReDI community comprises students and volunteers united by their participation in and commitment to respectful intellectual exchange. Therefore, ReDI School commits to providing an environment where the rights, safety, dignity and worth of every individual are respected.
* The intellectual exchange also implies acting responsibly in a community setting, with respect for the rights of other students and volunteers and for the property, shared resources, and agreements associated with that community.&#x20;
* Since the code is directed toward maintaining the standards of the ReDI community and the local community, ReDI School reserves the right to dismiss students or volunteers whose conduct is objectionable and/or interferes with the educational objectives of the School or another member of the community.

<summary>How does ReDI define objectionable conduct?</summary>

Objectionable conduct is defined as harassment, unwanted contact, or otherwise objectionable behavior, whether directed at or independent of other ReDI School community members. This includes:

* **Insults, gestures, or abusive words,** in the immediate presence and/or directed to another person **that may reasonably cause emotional distress or provoke a violent response**. How this applies to an online environment:
  * The direct or indirect use of insults, degrading language, or disrespectful comments on the opinions of others during video calls and/or in written instant communication are not tolerated under any circumstances.
  * Community members are expected to refer to their colleagues by their preferred names and personal pronouns (such as “he/him,” “she/her,” or “they/them”), as long as they have been communicated. Failure to do so on purpose will be considered abusive behaviour and will not be tolerated under any circumstances.
* **Lewd or indecent conduct during a ReDI School sponsored activity.** This includes, but is not limited to, any unauthorised use of electronic or other devices to make an audio or video record that would be an **invasion of privacy**. How this applies to an online environment:
  * The video recording or taking of screenshots involving other community members during classes, events and any other ReDI activity will only be tolerated with the explicit permission of all the parties involved. Successive use of such media content in different platforms and contexts will require the explicit written permission of all the parties involved. Failure to secure an explicit authorisation will constitute a breach of the Code of Conduct and will not be tolerated under any circumstances.
* Other types of **prohibited discrimination** are discriminatory harassment, nonconsensual personal contact, and sexual harassment as defined by law. How this applies to an online environment:
  * Instant messages, emails, voice messages, or video gestures containing discriminating attitudes towards other ReDI community members will not be tolerated under any circumstances, irrespective of whether they take place during a ReDI event or outside of this context.
  * Nonconsensual personal contact in an online environment includes unauthorised contact of another community member for sexual and/or romantic purposes or in a way that could reasonably cause emotional distress.
