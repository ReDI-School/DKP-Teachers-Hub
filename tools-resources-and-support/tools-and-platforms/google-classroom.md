### How to Upload Materials on Google Classroom

Go to Classwork. Go to Create. Select material to upload material, which is shared with the students. Select Topic to create a new section that can hold multiple materials.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Draft function: drafts are only visible to teachers - not to the students (yet). \
You can already work on material before sharing it with students. In order to share it, you publish the material.
{% endhint %}

### Review Projects

* Go to the Grades section. You find all the students; you can see who turned in the homework. Once you click on it, you can review their work, write a comment, and return it.&#x20;
