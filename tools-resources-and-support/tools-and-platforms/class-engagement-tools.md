  * Icebreakers: Ask students about their expectations or background knowledge.

### Icebreaker Ideas

You can use quick icebreakers at the start of your sessions to energize participants, build connections, and create an engaging and interactive learning environment. Here is a list of icebreakers. They shouldn't take more than 5 minutes to run.

#### 1. Two Truths and a Lie

* **Description:** Participants share three statements about themselves—two true and one false. The group has to guess which one is the lie.
* **How to Run:** Use breakout rooms for smaller groups or let everyone participate in the main room.
* **Objective:** Participants get to know each other in a fun way.

#### 2. Virtual Scavenger Hunt

* **Description:** Give participants a list of items to find in their home within 1-2 minutes (e.g., something red, something that makes noise).
* **How to Run:** Ask them to bring the items back to the camera and share a quick story about one of them.
* **Objective:** The activity is an energizer.

#### 3. Emoji Reactions

* **Description:** Pose a question or statement (e.g., "How are you feeling about today’s session?") and ask participants to respond using emojis only.
* **How to Run:** Use the chat in Zoom.&#x20;
* **Objective:** It is an easy way for participants to share how they are doing.&#x20;
