### Why track attendance?

We ask learners to join at least 80% of the sessions to obtain a certificate. We believe students can only learn if they attend. That's why attendance tracking is essential. ReDI follows up regularly with students with low attendance to offer support.&#x20;

### Attendance Status per Session <a href="#h.qcivutk4t54j_l" id="h.qcivutk4t54j_l"></a>

**100% – Present:** Arrive on time, actively participate, and keep the camera on.

**50% – Excused:** Notify in advance if unable to attend

**50% – Late:** Arrival more than 15 minutes late. _Please mark as "Excused". If no excuse is known, select "Other." No explanation from students is required._

**50% – Early Leave:** Leaving before the break. _Please mark as "Excused". If no excuse is known, select "Other." No explanation from students is required._

**0% – Absent:** No prior communication of absence

### Camera on Policy

Students will only be marked as "present", if they join the class with their **camera on**.&#x20;

If a student should experience internet connection problems during the class, they should either write it in the chat or unmute themselves to inform teachers and fellow students. If this is not possible, students should inform the class through a message in their students slack channel.
