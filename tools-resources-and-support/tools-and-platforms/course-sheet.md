# Course Sheet

* **Link:** The link to your Course Sheet is pinned in Slack.
* **Availability & Ownership:** Volunteers assign themselves to the session. They show when they are available to teach.
* **Feedback:** Bootcamps & Circles have a feedback tab where we collect feedback about the session.

### Add your availability

Before the Planning Sessions and Mid-Semester Planning, we will allocate the roles in the course sheet, please for that:

Change your availability status under your name accordingly:

* **🧑‍🏫 Available (Lead session)**

&#x20;You are available to **lead the session**. This means you can **prepare the content, guide the class, and take the main teaching role**. You’ll be the primary point of contact for learners during the session.

* **✅ Available (Assist only)**

You are available to **support the session**, but not to lead it. You can help answer questions, support group work, or assist the lead teacher as needed.

* **🟡 Backup (Preferable)**

You are **preferably available as a backup**. You’re not completely sure you can join, but if someone drops out or there's an urgent need, you could potentially step in.

* **❌ Not Available**

You are **not available** for this session and should not be assigned any role.

### Not available anymore?

* Mark it in the Course Sheet so that others can see it and let your team knows in your teaching team communication channel
