# Slack

You’ll automatically be added to your **teaching team channel** and your **student channel**. Additionally, you're welcome to join our community channels in **Berlin**, **NRW**, and **Hamburg** to stay updated on local events and news.

Please make sure to **check Slack regularly** during the semester and use it to communicate with your team—especially if you’re unable to make it to a session.

We encourage you to not only use Slack for logistics or emergencies, but also to **share materials, ideas, and good vibes** with your team. A supportive and communicative environment makes a big difference!

#### **Important: Post-Class Slackbot Check-In**

After every session, a **Slackbot** will be released in your teaching channel. One designated team member should fill it in to ensure a smooth handover for the next session.

The Slackbot will ask:

* **How was the session? (What went well? Any ideas for improvement?)**
* **Any follow-ups needed for the next session?**
* **Did the team you supported have any recurring questions?**
* **Anything else to share?**
* **Additional feedback**

⚠️ This is _really important_ to help the next team come prepared. Be empathetic—imagine stepping into a class without knowing what happened before!
