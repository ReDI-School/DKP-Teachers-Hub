# Teacher Admission

**Spring Semester Deadline:** End of January | **Fall Semester Deadline :** July

We evaluate each profile based on the current needs of our Teaching Teams. Once your participation is confirmed, you will receive an email with the course you have been assigned to. We kindly ask you to confirm your availability as soon as possible to ensure our teams are complete.

After that, you will gain access to our Self-Onboarding process, where you’ll find all the tools, information, and materials you’ll need to facilitate your classes.

If there is no available space at the moment, we will include you on our _Waiting List_ and consider you for future volunteer opportunities or roles within our organization.
