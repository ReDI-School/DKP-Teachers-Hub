# Planning Session

**Spring Semester:** February | **Fall Semester:** August

The goal of this meeting is to ensure that everyone clearly understands their roles—in the classroom, within the course, and as part of the teaching team, and can collaborate effectively to provide students with the best learning experience throughout the semester.

To prepare for the session, it is recommended that you review:

* The lesson content
* The course structure
* The roles and their responsibilities
* The available tools

Reviewing these in advance will help clarify any questions or doubts from the start.

Before the meeting, please share your availability ahead of time. During this session, roles will be assigned based on your interests, experience, and availability relative to the course content.

We have allocated space for a second planning session in case it is needed.
