# Teachers Onboarding

**When?** Once you're admitted!

The Teacher Onboarding process includes the completion of the <mark style="color:orange;">**Self-Onboarding module**</mark>. During this step, you'll gain access to our teaching tools, class materials, and important internal resources that will support you throughout the semester. You'll also receive a clear overview of your role and responsibilities as a volunteer teacher.

To confirm your participation, we’ll kindly ask you to electronically sign the **Volunteer Agreement**. This ensures you're officially part of the program and helps us stay aligned on expectations
