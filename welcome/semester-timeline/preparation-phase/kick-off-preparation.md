# Kick-Off Preparation

**Spring Semester:** February | **Fall Semester:** August

The Kick-Off is co-facilitated by the entire teaching team—not just one teacher—highlighting a supportive, team-based approach. This collaborative format ensures shared responsibility and gives all teachers first-hand experience with session facilitation. It also helps foster stronger connection with students from the very beginning.

During the [Planning Session,](planning-session.md) we will start the [Kick-Off Preparation,](kick-off-preparation.md) assigning roles together as a team. By that time, the agenda will already be prepared, and you can find both the **Kick-Off agenda** and the **slides to be used** in your Course Sheet.

To get ready:

* **Discuss Roles During the Planning Session**: Each teacher will take responsibility for a segment of the Kick-Off.
* **Sign Up in Your Course Sheet**: Confirm your participation by adding your name to the Kick-Off agenda.
* **Prepare Your Segment**: Review and update the materials and tools for your assigned part, and be ready to lead it during the session.

We will provide you with pre-made materials to inspire you, but you are responsible for updating and adapting your part of the session.

Feel free to bring your creativity and use any additional materials that align with your teaching style and make you feel more comfortable.
