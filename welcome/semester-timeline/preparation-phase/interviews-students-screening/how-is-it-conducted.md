# How is it conducted?

**Interview Preparation**

* You will receive the information on this page, as well as the interview form for your course along with your calendar invite for the interviews. Please accept or decline the invitation to confirm your attendance so we can plan accordingly.
* A non mandatory **30-minute briefing** will also be held on interview day to review the process and address any questions before we start.

**On Interview day**

1. **Join the Zoom call** from your calendar invite.
2. The ReDI Team will welcome you and assign you to a breakout room.
3. A max of 6 students will be sent to you **one at a time** for **1:1 interviews (20 minutes total)**:
   * 15 minutes conversation
   * 5 minutes for notes and recommendation
4. A dedicated **Slack channel** will be set up for real-time communication throughout the interviews and breakout sessions. Once you complete an interview, notify the team on Slack, and the next student will be sent your way.
