### Continuation Form

We will send a survey to ask whether you would like to **continue as a teacher volunteer for another semester** and if you are interested in supporting ReDI in other ways, such as mentoring, trainings, supporting the teaching team, or promoting our programs. We are happy to have you remain an active part of our community. An early response of this form will support us in the recruitment process for the next semesters since we give priority to our current teachers.

**When?** After completing teaching the semester

A certificate will be issued upon successful completion of the semester, provided that you have completed at least 50% of your teaching participation, ideally having taken full ownership of at least two classes, or demonstrated exceptional commitment.

If these criteria are not met, each case will be reviewed individually; however, we trust that participants will reflect on whether requesting a certificate matches their level of commitment.
