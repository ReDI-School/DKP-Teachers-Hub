# Final Project

**Spring & Fall Semester:** Date will be included on the course sheet

This phase takes place toward the end of the Beginners and Intermediate courses and is designed to help learners gain practical experience and build a strong portfolio. It also supports their growth in key areas such as:

🔹 **Team Collaboration** – Work with peers in a team setting, simulating real-world work environments.\
🔹 **Hands-on Learning** – Apply coding, design, or data skills to solve real-life challenges.\
🔹 **Mentor Support** – Receive guidance from teachers on realistic case scenarios.\
🔹 **Final Presentation** – Present their project to classmates, mentors, and sometimes even industry professionals.

It’s a valuable step in boosting learners’ confidence, teamwork, and job-readiness.
