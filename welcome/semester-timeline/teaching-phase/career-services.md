# Career Services

**Spring & Fall Semester:** During the semester. Dates will be included on the course sheet.

***

**Career Week: Regular Courses & Circles**\
The Career Week at ReDI School is a week of training webinars designed to help students connect with industry professionals, improve job-related skills, explore career opportunities, and boost their job readiness. More info: \[Career Services]

✅ Students need to attend **at least 2 career events** during the semester (within or outside Career Week) in order to graduate. Students can choose the topics that interest them most.\
✅ Other career events during the semester might include company visits, networking opportunities, and mentoring matching events.\
During Career Week, regular classes are on hold. We use this time to organize teaching team touchpoints.

***

**Career Bootcamp: UX/UI & Full Stack Bootcamp**\
We are currently adapting the format of the Final Career Project, which will take place in the final weeks of the Bootcamp—after your regular classes have ended. These weeks are already marked in your course sheet.\
More information will be shared with you soon!
