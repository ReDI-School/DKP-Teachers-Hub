# Community Events

Local Community Events at ReDI School are informal gatherings where students, alumni, mentors, and industry professionals come together to network and share quality time. These events help you connect with the tech community in your city (Berlin, Hamburg, or NRW). We’ll organize two community events per location this semester.

If you’re not yet included in our community channels and want to stay informed about upcoming events, please let us know so we can invite you based on your preferred location.
